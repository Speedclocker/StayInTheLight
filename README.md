# Game

Let's try to develop a little game...

A simple *make* command to create the binaries.

Launch Rogue.


# Mapping

*make MapCreator* command in Mapping folder to create the binaries used by the map editor program.
To create new maps, launch :
./MapCreator [Number of height layers] [Size in dimension X] [Size in dimension Y] [Size of a map tile] [Image file containing the tileset]

ex : 
./MapCreator 2 30 30 16 ../data/imgs/tileset.png
